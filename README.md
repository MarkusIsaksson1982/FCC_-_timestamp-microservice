Submission for the freeCodeCamp assignment https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/timestamp-microservice

I might have misunderstood some of the intentions of the project regarding the index.html where I made an own file and put it in the public folder, when there already was an index.html file in the views folder, and where it has seemed to me afterwards, that it is a more common practice to have the index.html file in the views folder.

I also updated the style.css file.

Since I passed the freeCodeCamp tests with the .js files, these are left as they were in Gitpod when I submitted the assignment.
